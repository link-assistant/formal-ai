## 1. Executive summary

The `Auto Release` job is the only job that turned any of the four analysed runs
red — but it failed for **two entirely different reasons**, which is why the
failure looked intermittent and resisted a single explanation:

| # | Defect | Severity | Evidence | Verdict |
|---|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Auto Release — `cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes`** | ❌ failure | runs 29214051612, 29484631709 | **Real bug in `scripts/version-and-commit.rs`** — fixed in this PR |
| 2 | **Auto Release — `No space left on device`, runner killed** | ❌ failure, **silent** | runs 29312084458, 29485000765 | **Real infrastructure failure** — fixed in this PR |
| 3 | **docs.rs "All builds failed"** ("docs generation shows as failing") | ❌ failure | docs.rs build 3868612 | **Upstream bug** in `lindera-jieba` — reported, not fixable here |
| 4 | **`desktop-release.yml` publishes partial releases as green** | ⚠️ **false positive** | code read | **Real bug** — fixed in this PR |
| 5 | **`desktop-release.yml` uploads Linux/Windows artifacts unverified** | ⚠️ **false negative** | code read | **Real gap** — fixed in this PR |
| 6 | **`desktop-release.yml` runs show as `skipped`** | ℹ️ cosmetic | job `if:` at `desktop-release.yml:80-84` | **Correct behaviour**, not a defect — see §4.6 |

Defects 1 and 2 are the serious ones, and defect 2 is worse than defect 1: by the
time the runner died, the crate had **already been published to crates.io**, so
those runs shipped a version with **no Docker image and no GitHub Release**.

## 2. Timeline / sequence of events

All times UTC, from [`data/run-*.json`](./data) and [`data/job-*.json`](./data).

| Time | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026-07-12 23:48:07 | Push to `main` (`2dcaeee4`) starts run `29214051612`. |
| 2026-07-13 00:17:36 | `Auto Release` (job `86709184220`) starts. Fails at **step 8, "Collect changelog and bump version"** — defect #1. |
| 2026-07-14 06:40:46 | Push to `main` (`64cb3b84`) starts run `29312084458`. |
| 2026-07-14 06:57:50 | `Auto Release` (job `87020644690`) starts. Fails with **no failed step at all** — the runner worker died writing its own diag log — defect #2. |
| 2026-07-16 08:45:55 | Merge of PR #731 (`6b1910a3`) starts run `29484631709`. |
| 2026-07-16 08:51:53 | Merge of PR #690 (`9052d2ca`) starts run `29485000765`, **6 minutes after the previous one and while it is still running**. |
| 2026-07-16 09:05:41 | `Auto Release` for the *older* run (job `87580040366`) starts. |
| 2026-07-16 09:07:33 | It logs `Local branch is behind remote, rebasing...` then `Error rebasing onto origin/main: Command failed: error: cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes.` Step 8 fails; steps 9–21 skip — defect #1. |
| 2026-07-16 09:21:58 | `Auto Release` for the newer run (job `87583325043`) starts and dies with `No space left on device` — defect #2. |

**The 08:45 / 08:51 pair is the reproduction of defect #1.** Two releases landing
on `main` six minutes apart is precisely the race the rebase bug needs: the older
run had already staged its version bump when the newer release's commit appeared
on `origin/main`, and `git rebase` refuses to run against a dirty index.

This also explains why the bug looked flaky rather than broken. Of the 25 most
recent `push` runs on `main`, only these four failed; the rest had no concurrent
push land inside their release window and so never rebased at all.

### 2.1 Why the evidence was hard to obtain

For jobs `87020644690` and `87583325043`, `gh run view --log` returns
`log not found` and the API log endpoint returns `BlobNotFound` / HTTP 404 (see
[`data/api-404-job-87583325043.txt`](./data/api-404-job-87583325043.txt)). **This is
not a tooling problem — it is a symptom of the defect itself.** The runner ran out
of disk while flushing its own log, so there is no log blob to download.

The evidence lives only in the job's **failure annotations**
([`data/annotations-87583325043.json`](./data/annotations-87583325043.json)), which
is the same lesson issue #523 recorded: for runner-level crashes, fetch
annotations, not step logs.

## 4. Root-cause analysis

### 4.1 Defect #1 — `cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes`

**Evidence (verbatim, [`data/autorelease-87580040366.log`](./data/autorelease-87580040366.log) lines 1344-1345):**

```
Local branch is behind remote, rebasing...
Error rebasing onto origin/main: Command failed: error: cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes.
```

**Root cause.** `scripts/version-and-commit.rs` did its work in this order:

1. read the manifest and compute the new version,
2. write the bump into `Cargo.toml` / `CHANGELOG.md`,
3. **`git add`** those files,
4. *then* `git fetch` + `git rebase origin/main`.

Step 4 cannot work after step 3. `git rebase` hard-refuses to run against a dirty
index — that is documented, intended git behaviour, not an edge case. The ordering
was only ever exercised when the fetch found new commits, which needs a concurrent
push to land inside the release window; hence the intermittency.

Two adjacent defects in the same function, found while fixing this:

- **A mislabel.** The code rebased whenever `local != remote`, and reported that as
  `Local branch is behind remote`. Being *ahead* of the remote — the normal state
  right after committing a bump — is not being behind. Fixed by counting with
  `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<branch>`.
- **A tag-ordering hazard.** The tag was created *before* the push-retry loop, so a
  `pull --rebase` retry inside that loop could leave the tag pointing at an
  orphaned pre-rebase commit. Fixed by tagging only after the commit reaches the
  remote.

**Fix.** `sync_with_remote()` now runs **early, while the tree is still clean**,
before the manifest is even read — so the bump is computed from the newest state of
the branch rather than a stale checkout, and there is no index to trip over.

**Regression tests** (`scripts/version-and-commit.rs`, run in CI via
`rust-script --test`): `syncs_with_concurrent_release_then_commits_bump_on_top`
builds a real repo with a bare origin, pushes a concurrent commit, and asserts the
bump lands on top; `syncing_after_staging_the_bump_fails` pins the *old* ordering as
an error (asserts `cannot rebase`), so the bug cannot be reintroduced;
`does_not_rebase_when_only_ahead_of_remote` covers the mislabel.

### 4.2 Defect #2 — `No space left on device` (the silent one)

**Evidence (verbatim, [`data/annotations-87583325043.json`](./data/annotations-87583325043.json)):**

```
System.IO.IOException: No space left on device : '/home/runner/actions-runner/cached/2.335.1/_diag/Worker_20260716-092159-utc.log'
```

**Root cause.** The release jobs build the crate with `cargo build --release`, then
build the Docker image — and [`Dockerfile`](../../../Dockerfile) is a two-stage build
whose `rust:1.96-slim` builder runs `cargo build --release --locked` **again**, on
top of a large base image. Hosted `ubuntu-latest` ships ~14 GB free on `/`. Two
release compiles plus the image layers exceed it and take the runner process itself
down.

**This is the same failure as issue #523**, whose fix — reclaiming disk by removing
unused pre-installed SDKs — was applied **only to the Pages job**. The release jobs
never got it. That is exactly the "if we have an issue in multiple places it should
be fixed in all of them" case from R8.

**Why it is worse than defect #1.** The job dies *after* step 11 (`cargo publish`)
has already succeeded. So these runs pushed a version to crates.io and then
produced no Docker image and no GitHub Release — a **silent partial release**, with
no failed step and no downloadable log to explain it.

**Fix.** The reclaim now lives in the shared
[`scripts/free-runner-disk.sh`](../../../scripts/free-runner-disk.sh) and runs in
**all three** heavy jobs: auto-release, manual-release, and the Pages job (which
now calls the shared script instead of its inline copy).

**Debug output for the next iteration (R6).** The script prints `df -h` before and
after, reports the MiB reclaimed, supports `RUNNER_DISK_DEBUG=1` for a
per-directory breakdown, and — most importantly — emits a
`::warning title=Low runner disk::` annotation when less than `RUNNER_DISK_MIN_MIB`
(default 6144) remains. A future recurrence therefore leaves a diagnosable
annotation behind even when, as here, no log survives.

### 4.3 Defect #3 — "docs generation shows as failing" is docs.rs, not GitHub Actions

The repository has exactly **two** workflows (`release.yml`, `desktop-release.yml`)
and neither has a failing docs job. The failing docs generation is **docs.rs**,
which reports *All builds failed* for `formal-ai` 0.296.0 (build 3868612).

**Evidence (verbatim, [`data/docsrs-build-3868612-formal-ai-0.296.0.log`](./data/docsrs-build-3868612-formal-ai-0.296.0.log)):**

```
Compiling lindera-jieba v3.0.7
error: failed to run custom build command for `lindera-jieba v3.0.7`
  Error: LinderaError { kind: Io, source: Failed to create dummy input directory:
  ".../mecab-jieba-0.1.1" Caused by: File exists (os error 17) }
```

**Root cause.** `lindera-jieba`'s build script creates a directory with the
non-idempotent `create_dir`, which fails with `AlreadyExists` (errno 17) if the
directory is already there. docs.rs reuses `/opt/rustwide/target` across builds, so
the second build script run in a reused sandbox always fails. `create_dir_all`, or
tolerating `AlreadyExists`, is the fix.

**Bisected precisely.** formal-ai 0.183.0 builds green; 0.184.0 fails. The only
Cargo.toml change between them is `+meta-language = "0.39"`. The chain is
`formal-ai` → `meta-language` (`Cargo.toml:43`) → `lindera ^3.0.7` (non-optional,
`default_features = false, features = ["embed-jieba"]`) → `lindera-jieba`.

**Not fixable in this repository.** `meta-language` exposes only `default = []` and
`doublets`, so no feature selection here can drop `lindera`, and no
`[package.metadata.docs.rs]` setting would help. Proof that it is upstream:
`meta-language` 0.45.0 fails on docs.rs identically (build 3577282), with no
formal-ai involved. `lindera` 4.0.0 exists, while `meta-language` pins `^3.0.7`.
Reported upstream — see §6.

### 4.4 Defect #4 — `desktop-release.yml` reports partial releases as complete (false positive)

The `finalize` job ran with `if: always() && ...`, failed **only when zero**
fragments existed, and hardcoded all six builders into `BUILD-PROVENANCE.txt`.
Because the build matrix uses `fail-fast: false`, a run where five of six
architectures failed still published a green, authoritative-looking
`SHA256SUMS.txt` **asserting builds that never happened**. This is the textbook
false positive the issue asks about: green means "all desktop assets shipped", and
callers rely on that.

**Fix.** The provenance now lists only builders that actually produced a fragment,
names the missing targets under an `INCOMPLETE :` heading, drops the word
"authoritative", and the job **fails after** uploading — the partial manifest is
still published for debugging, but the run ends red.

Two more defects fixed in the same file:

- **Attest-after-upload.** Both the desktop and vscode jobs uploaded assets and
  *then* attested them, leaving assets publicly downloadable without provenance for
  the length of the attest step — and permanently so if attest failed. Attestation
  now runs before the upload in **both** jobs (R8).
- **A concurrency group that never dedups.** The group read
  `github.event.release.tag_name || github.event.inputs.tag || github.run_id`, but
  the automatic `workflow_run` path carries **neither** of the first two, so it fell
  through to the always-unique `run_id`. Concurrent runs for the same tag therefore
  raced on `gh release upload --clobber` and on `finalize`'s `SHA256SUMS.txt`. Now
  keyed on `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha`, which that event does carry.

### 4.5 Defect #5 — Linux/Windows artifacts shipped unverified (false negative)

The smoke test was gated `if: matrix.ebflag == '--mac'`, so **four of the six**
targets were uploaded to the release with nothing checking that electron-builder
produced them under the expected names. A rename or a partial package would ship
silently — a false negative.

**Fix.** A `Smoke test Linux/Windows release artifacts` step verifies the expected
versioned artifacts exist and are non-empty for each Linux/Windows matrix leg. The
deep macOS checks (`hdiutil`, `codesign`, `spctl`, `stapler`) are macOS-only by
nature, but existence and non-emptiness are checkable everywhere.

### 4.6 Non-defect — `desktop-release.yml` runs showing as `skipped`

The repeated `skipped` runs visible in the issue's screenshot are **correct**. The
job's `if:` (`desktop-release.yml:80-84`) requires `head_branch == 'main'`, and the
skipped runs are `pull_request` events on issue branches. This is cosmetic list
noise, not a false positive, and suppressing it would mean weakening a guard that
does its job. **No change.**

Also checked and found sound: the required-asset count `17` in
`scripts/desktop-release-resolve.sh:230` matches `expected_desktop_assets()`.

## 5. Template comparison (R4)

Compared against
[rust-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template](https://github.com/link-foundation/rust-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template)
(the applicable one; the js/python/csharp templates share the workflow *shape* but
not the Rust release script).

**Already fixed upstream, drifted here.** The template had the identical rebase bug
(its issue #67) and now rebases while clean *and* ships a regression test. Our copy
had drifted and kept the broken ordering — which is the whole of defect #1. No
upstream report needed; we adopted the upstream approach.

**Still broken upstream → reported (§6).** The `local != remote` mislabel
(template `release.yml:735-736`) and the tag-before-push-rebase hazard (template
`release.yml:872` vs `:879-903`) both still exist upstream.

**Other drift found, recorded for follow-up.** These are pre-existing gaps rather
than causes of the analysed failures, and restoring them is a larger change than
this PR should carry:

| Template feature | State here | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| Cargo.lock guard job + `scripts/check-cargo-lock.rs` | deleted | **False negative** — cache keys use `hashFiles('**/Cargo.lock')`, so a stale lock silently poisons cache keys |
| `smoke-test-published-crate` | removed | A broken publish is not caught |
| `setup-buildx-resilient` composite action on the GHCR path | removed | Transient buildx setup failures fail the release |
| Test matrix across OSes | narrowed to `ubuntu-latest` | Platform regressions escape |

---

## 6. Upstream reports (R7)

| Repository | Defect | Why it belongs there |
|---|---|---|
| `link-foundation/rust-ai-driven-development-pipeline-template` | `local != remote` mislabelled as "behind"; tag created before the push-rebase retry | Both still present in the template's `release.yml`; every repo generated from it inherits them |
| `lindera` | `build.rs` uses non-idempotent `create_dir`; fails with `AlreadyExists` in reused sandboxes such as docs.rs | The failing code is `lindera-jieba`'s build script |
| `link-foundation/meta-language` | Pins `lindera ^3.0.7` (non-optional), so every dependent's docs.rs build fails | `meta-language` itself fails on docs.rs (build 3577282); it can upgrade to lindera 4.x and/or gate `lindera` behind a feature |

Each report includes a reproducible example, a workaround, and a concrete fix
suggestion, as the issue requires.

---

## 7. Known components / libraries considered

| Problem | Existing component | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Runner disk exhaustion | [`jlumbroso/free-disk-space`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/free-disk-space), [`easimon/maximize-build-space`](https://github.com/easimon/maximize-build-space) | **Not adopted.** Both are third-party actions in the release path — a supply-chain surface on the job that publishes to crates.io and GHCR. Our need is four `rm -rf` paths and a `df`; `scripts/free-runner-disk.sh` is ~40 lines, has no external dependency, and is testable locally. Their approach (remove unused SDKs) is what we implement. |
| Concurrent-release races | GitHub `concurrency` groups | **Adopted** for `desktop-release.yml` (§4.4). Not sufficient for `release.yml`: the race there is between *separate pushes to main*, each of which legitimately must release, so serialising is not the answer — rebasing correctly is. |
| Release automation | `release-plz`, `cargo-release`, `semantic-release` | **Not adopted here.** Any of them would replace `version-and-commit.rs` wholesale, and `release-plz` handles this exact race properly. That is a strategically sound migration but far beyond a CI-reliability fix; recorded as a follow-up candidate. |
| Build provenance | `actions/attest` | **Already in use**; the defect was ordering (§4.4), not the component. |
| docs.rs build isolation | `cargo-docs-rs` / `DOCS_RS` env guard | Would let `lindera` detect the docs.rs sandbox — this is the suggested fix in the upstream report, not something we can apply from here. |
