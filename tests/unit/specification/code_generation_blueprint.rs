//! Issue #340: composite `write_program` blueprint tests.
//!
//! A composite request the verified template catalog cannot resolve to a single
//! template (HTTP GET -> parse JSON -> compute mean/median -> output) must no
//! longer dead-end on `write_program_unsupported`. The blueprint synthesizer
//! decomposes the request into capabilities and returns a real, idiomatic
//! program with an honest "not run" execution report. These tests live beside
//! `code_generation` to keep each specification file within the repository
//! line-count limit.
