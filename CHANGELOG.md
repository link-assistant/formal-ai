- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

### Changed

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

### Added
- Added a Telegram webhook endpoint backed by the symbolic engine, plus execution metadata for hello-world code answers and verification coverage for private and public chat updates.

### Added
- Added a `formal-ai telegram` CLI subcommand that defaults to Telegram long polling (`getUpdates`) and keeps the existing webhook server as `--mode=webhook`, configured through `lino-arguments` so flags, environment variables, and `.lenv`/`.env` files all feed the same parser.
- Introduced `TelegramPollingConfig`, `parse_get_updates_response`, the `TelegramTransport` trait, and a curl-backed default transport so the polling loop is fully unit-tested without a network.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Added
- Added arithmetic, concept-lookup, conversation-recall, and explicit-JavaScript-execution handlers to the universal solver so the same loop now answers "what is 2 + 2?", "what is Wikipedia?", "what is my name?", and "please run this javascript: ..." prompts (issue #14).
- Added `solve_with_history`, `ConversationRole`, and `ConversationTurn` to the library API so every surface can carry conversation memory through the same solver loop.
- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

### Changed
- Re-implemented `docs/demo/formal_ai_worker.js` as a universal-solver port: the hardcoded prompt→answer table is gone and every reply now walks greeting, identity, arithmetic, concept-lookup, recall, JavaScript-execution, hello-world, and unknown-fallback handlers that mirror `src/solver.rs`. JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

### Added
- Multilingual chat across Rust, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and the web demo: greetings, identity, unknown-answer, and concept-lookup handlers reply in Russian, Hindi, and Chinese in addition to English; the input language is detected from Unicode blocks (Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK) (issue #16).
- Browser Wikipedia REST fallback for `What is X?` prompts that miss the offline `CONCEPTS` table; the offline corpus still wins and the network answer carries `source:` evidence so the citation can be audited.
- `data/seed/` as the canonical knowledge surface for every interface: `src/seed.rs` `include_str!`-embeds every `.lino` file and exposes typed accessors (`multilingual_responses`, `concepts`, `tools`, `language_rules`, `prompt_patterns`, `intent_routing`) that the Rust library, CLI binary, HTTP server, and Telegram webhook all read; the browser worker fetches the same files through `src/web/seed_loader.js`.
- Data-driven intent routing via `data/seed/intent-routing.lino` with explicit `keyword` / `phrase` / `token` / `combo` match semantics, replacing hardcoded match arms in the dispatcher.
- `seed::merged_bundle()` / `seed::parse_bundle()` plus their JS mirrors `FormalAiSeed.parseBundle` / `FormalAiSeed.loadFromBundle` give the seed a single-file Links Notation round-trip.
- Append-only memory log in the web demo (`src/web/memory.js`) with Export memory, Import memory, and Download bundle buttons; reasoning steps and tool invocations are recorded alongside chat turns, and no delete/forget/clear API is exposed.
- Tool registry panel surfacing seeded tools (`http_fetch`, `web_search`, `wikipedia_lookup`, `eval_js`, `read_local_file`, `append_memory`, `export_memory`) with a `thinking` vs `agent` mode badge.
- Playwright e2e suite (`tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`) covering multilingual greetings/identity, offline + Wikipedia `What is X?` resolution, export/import round-trip, append-only enforcement, bundle download, tool registry, and reasoning-event logging; runs both against `npx serve src/web` (PR) and against `link-assistant.github.io/formal-ai` (post-deploy).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-16/` with raw GitHub data, online research, requirements-to-implementation mapping, and a Follow-Up section covering the universal seed loader and bundle round-trip.

### Changed
- Moved the deployable demo from `docs/demo/` to `src/web/` so it sits next to the other library/CLI/web sources; the GitHub Pages deploy job already targets `src/web`.
- Relocated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to the repository root next to `VISION.md` and expanded it with R90–R104 (move to `src/web`, multilingual surface, Wikipedia fallback, e2e coverage, export/import, append-only constraint, seed externalization, tool registry UI, reasoning/tool-call events, single-file bundle, universal seed loader, intent routing as data, bundle round-trip).
- Rewrote `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js` to initialise mutable `MULTILINGUAL_ANSWERS`, `CONCEPTS`, and `TOOLS` tables from the seed instead of carrying hardcoded literals; `solve()` now returns structured `steps[]` and `toolCalls[]` for the append-only log.

### Fixed
- Wikipedia and concept-lookup source URLs now render in human-readable IRI form (e.g. `https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Изумруд`) across every formal-ai surface — web demo, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and library — while the underlying link target stays the canonical percent-encoded URI so the link still resolves (issue #21).

### Added
- `formal_ai::humanize_url` — public helper that decodes percent-encoded UTF-8 sequences in a URL while preserving reserved URI delimiters (`; / ? : @ & = + $ , #`), with `String::from_utf8` fallback for malformed input. Mirrored by `humanizeUrl` in `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js`. Covered by Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK, Japanese, Arabic, query-string-preservation, malformed-escape, lowercase-hex, and invalid-UTF-8 unit tests.
- Playwright e2e regression test that stubs the Wikipedia REST endpoint with the exact percent-encoded URL pattern from the bug report and asserts both the readable display text and the canonical `href` are present on the rendered assistant message.
- `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` — full root-cause analysis (URI vs IRI), reproducible curl example, library survey, and upstream considerations.

### Changed
- **Export memory** now produces the full, self-contained agent state by default on every interface (issue #18). The browser **Export memory** topbar button writes `formal-ai-memory.lino` as a complete `formal_ai_bundle` — seed files (rules, concepts, tools, multilingual responses), UI preferences, environment metadata, version, and the full append-only event log — instead of only the in-session events. `formal-ai memory export` matches: it defaults to the full bundle and accepts `--events-only` to opt back into the legacy `demo_memory` shape (R109, R113).

### Added
- `FormalAiMemory.exportFullMemory({ seed, events, preferences, info })`, `FormalAiMemory.importFullMemory(text)`, and `FormalAiMemory.suggestMigrations({ imported, current })` in `src/web/memory.js`, mirrored on the Rust side by `memory::export_full_memory`, `memory::import_full_memory`, `memory::suggest_migrations`, `BundleInfo`, and `ParsedBundle` (re-exported from `formal_ai`'s crate root) so embedders writing their own surface get the same defaults (R109, R110, R111, R113).
- Header-agnostic imports: both `formal-ai memory import` / `formal-ai bundle import` (CLI) and `handleImportMemory` (browser) auto-detect `formal_ai_bundle` and legacy `demo_memory` documents so older exports keep round-tripping (R110).
- Seed-version migration suggestions on import. When the imported bundle's `agent_info.version` differs from the running app, the browser memory-status indicator and the CLI (`Migration: <message>` via `eprintln!`) tell the user what changed in `data/seed/` so they can take action without reading code (R111).
- Rewritten **Attach full memory** block in the prefilled "Report issue" body: explicitly tells users that the export is the full memory of the agent, walks them through wrapping it in a `.zip` on macOS / Windows / Linux (GitHub does not yet accept `.lino` attachments), and reminds them to redact sensitive content (R112).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-18/` with raw GitHub data, root-cause analysis, requirement-to-implementation mapping (R109-R114), and verification notes.
- Playwright e2e coverage in `tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`: `Export memory downloads a full formal_ai_bundle by default` asserts `formal_ai_bundle` / `seed_files` / `preferences` in the downloaded file; `Import memory accepts a formal_ai_bundle and reports seed migrations` exercises the auto-detect path and the migration-suggestion surface; the report-issue test now also asserts the `.zip` and redaction guidance (R114).
- Rust unit coverage in `src/memory.rs`: `full_memory_round_trip_preserves_seed_preferences_and_events`, `import_full_memory_accepts_legacy_demo_memory`, `suggest_migrations_flags_seed_version_drift`, `suggest_migrations_flags_legacy_only_import`, `suggest_migrations_is_quiet_when_versions_match`.

### Fixed
- Hardened the GitHub Pages demo release gate so live e2e tests wait for the exact deployed commit and load cache-busted static assets.
- Fixed live GitHub Pages Playwright navigation so tests preserve the `/formal-ai/` repository subpath and wait for seeded manual-mode data before multilingual prompts.

- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

### Changed

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

### Added
- Added a Telegram webhook endpoint backed by the symbolic engine, plus execution metadata for hello-world code answers and verification coverage for private and public chat updates.

### Added
- Added a `formal-ai telegram` CLI subcommand that defaults to Telegram long polling (`getUpdates`) and keeps the existing webhook server as `--mode=webhook`, configured through `lino-arguments` so flags, environment variables, and `.lenv`/`.env` files all feed the same parser.
- Introduced `TelegramPollingConfig`, `parse_get_updates_response`, the `TelegramTransport` trait, and a curl-backed default transport so the polling loop is fully unit-tested without a network.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Added
- Added arithmetic, concept-lookup, conversation-recall, and explicit-JavaScript-execution handlers to the universal solver so the same loop now answers "what is 2 + 2?", "what is Wikipedia?", "what is my name?", and "please run this javascript: ..." prompts (issue #14).
- Added `solve_with_history`, `ConversationRole`, and `ConversationTurn` to the library API so every surface can carry conversation memory through the same solver loop.
- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

### Changed
- Re-implemented `docs/demo/formal_ai_worker.js` as a universal-solver port: the hardcoded prompt→answer table is gone and every reply now walks greeting, identity, arithmetic, concept-lookup, recall, JavaScript-execution, hello-world, and unknown-fallback handlers that mirror `src/solver.rs`. JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

### Added
- Multilingual chat across Rust, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and the web demo: greetings, identity, unknown-answer, and concept-lookup handlers reply in Russian, Hindi, and Chinese in addition to English; the input language is detected from Unicode blocks (Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK) (issue #16).
- Browser Wikipedia REST fallback for `What is X?` prompts that miss the offline `CONCEPTS` table; the offline corpus still wins and the network answer carries `source:` evidence so the citation can be audited.
- `data/seed/` as the canonical knowledge surface for every interface: `src/seed.rs` `include_str!`-embeds every `.lino` file and exposes typed accessors (`multilingual_responses`, `concepts`, `tools`, `language_rules`, `prompt_patterns`, `intent_routing`) that the Rust library, CLI binary, HTTP server, and Telegram webhook all read; the browser worker fetches the same files through `src/web/seed_loader.js`.
- Data-driven intent routing via `data/seed/intent-routing.lino` with explicit `keyword` / `phrase` / `token` / `combo` match semantics, replacing hardcoded match arms in the dispatcher.
- `seed::merged_bundle()` / `seed::parse_bundle()` plus their JS mirrors `FormalAiSeed.parseBundle` / `FormalAiSeed.loadFromBundle` give the seed a single-file Links Notation round-trip.
- Append-only memory log in the web demo (`src/web/memory.js`) with Export memory, Import memory, and Download bundle buttons; reasoning steps and tool invocations are recorded alongside chat turns, and no delete/forget/clear API is exposed.
- Tool registry panel surfacing seeded tools (`http_fetch`, `web_search`, `wikipedia_lookup`, `eval_js`, `read_local_file`, `append_memory`, `export_memory`) with a `thinking` vs `agent` mode badge.
- Playwright e2e suite (`tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`) covering multilingual greetings/identity, offline + Wikipedia `What is X?` resolution, export/import round-trip, append-only enforcement, bundle download, tool registry, and reasoning-event logging; runs both against `npx serve src/web` (PR) and against `link-assistant.github.io/formal-ai` (post-deploy).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-16/` with raw GitHub data, online research, requirements-to-implementation mapping, and a Follow-Up section covering the universal seed loader and bundle round-trip.

### Changed
- Moved the deployable demo from `docs/demo/` to `src/web/` so it sits next to the other library/CLI/web sources; the GitHub Pages deploy job already targets `src/web`.
- Relocated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to the repository root next to `VISION.md` and expanded it with R90–R104 (move to `src/web`, multilingual surface, Wikipedia fallback, e2e coverage, export/import, append-only constraint, seed externalization, tool registry UI, reasoning/tool-call events, single-file bundle, universal seed loader, intent routing as data, bundle round-trip).
- Rewrote `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js` to initialise mutable `MULTILINGUAL_ANSWERS`, `CONCEPTS`, and `TOOLS` tables from the seed instead of carrying hardcoded literals; `solve()` now returns structured `steps[]` and `toolCalls[]` for the append-only log.

### Changed
- **Export memory** now produces the full, self-contained agent state by default on every interface (issue #18). The browser **Export memory** topbar button writes `formal-ai-memory.lino` as a complete `formal_ai_bundle` — seed files (rules, concepts, tools, multilingual responses), UI preferences, environment metadata, version, and the full append-only event log — instead of only the in-session events. `formal-ai memory export` matches: it defaults to the full bundle and accepts `--events-only` to opt back into the legacy `demo_memory` shape (R109, R113).

### Added
- `FormalAiMemory.exportFullMemory({ seed, events, preferences, info })`, `FormalAiMemory.importFullMemory(text)`, and `FormalAiMemory.suggestMigrations({ imported, current })` in `src/web/memory.js`, mirrored on the Rust side by `memory::export_full_memory`, `memory::import_full_memory`, `memory::suggest_migrations`, `BundleInfo`, and `ParsedBundle` (re-exported from `formal_ai`'s crate root) so embedders writing their own surface get the same defaults (R109, R110, R111, R113).
- Header-agnostic imports: both `formal-ai memory import` / `formal-ai bundle import` (CLI) and `handleImportMemory` (browser) auto-detect `formal_ai_bundle` and legacy `demo_memory` documents so older exports keep round-tripping (R110).
- Seed-version migration suggestions on import. When the imported bundle's `agent_info.version` differs from the running app, the browser memory-status indicator and the CLI (`Migration: <message>` via `eprintln!`) tell the user what changed in `data/seed/` so they can take action without reading code (R111).
- Rewritten **Attach full memory** block in the prefilled "Report issue" body: explicitly tells users that the export is the full memory of the agent, walks them through wrapping it in a `.zip` on macOS / Windows / Linux (GitHub does not yet accept `.lino` attachments), and reminds them to redact sensitive content (R112).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-18/` with raw GitHub data, root-cause analysis, requirement-to-implementation mapping (R109-R114), and verification notes.
- Playwright e2e coverage in `tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`: `Export memory downloads a full formal_ai_bundle by default` asserts `formal_ai_bundle` / `seed_files` / `preferences` in the downloaded file; `Import memory accepts a formal_ai_bundle and reports seed migrations` exercises the auto-detect path and the migration-suggestion surface; the report-issue test now also asserts the `.zip` and redaction guidance (R114).
- Rust unit coverage in `src/memory.rs`: `full_memory_round_trip_preserves_seed_preferences_and_events`, `import_full_memory_accepts_legacy_demo_memory`, `suggest_migrations_flags_seed_version_drift`, `suggest_migrations_flags_legacy_only_import`, `suggest_migrations_is_quiet_when_versions_match`.

### Fixed
- Hardened the GitHub Pages demo release gate so live e2e tests wait for the exact deployed commit and load cache-busted static assets.
- Fixed live GitHub Pages Playwright navigation so tests preserve the `/formal-ai/` repository subpath and wait for seeded manual-mode data before multilingual prompts.

## [0.23.0] - 2026-05-15

- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed

- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license

- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.

- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

- Tool registry panel surfacing seeded tools (`http_fetch`, `web_search`, `wikipedia_lookup`, `eval_js`, `read_local_file`, `append_memory`, `export_memory`) with a `thinking` vs `agent` mode badge.
- Playwright e2e suite (`tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`) covering multilingual greetings/identity, offline + Wikipedia `What is X?` resolution, export/import round-trip, append-only enforcement, bundle download, tool registry, and reasoning-event logging; runs both against `npx serve src/web` (PR) and against `link-assistant.github.io/formal-ai` (post-deploy).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-16/` with raw GitHub data, online research, requirements-to-implementation mapping, and a Follow-Up section covering the universal seed loader and bundle round-trip.

### Changed
- Moved the deployable demo from `docs/demo/` to `src/web/` so it sits next to the other library/CLI/web sources; the GitHub Pages deploy job already targets `src/web`.
- Relocated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to the repository root next to `VISION.md` and expanded it with R90–R104 (move to `src/web`, multilingual surface, Wikipedia fallback, e2e coverage, export/import, append-only constraint, seed externalization, tool registry UI, reasoning/tool-call events, single-file bundle, universal seed loader, intent routing as data, bundle round-trip).
- Rewrote `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js` to initialise mutable `MULTILINGUAL_ANSWERS`, `CONCEPTS`, and `TOOLS` tables from the seed instead of carrying hardcoded literals; `solve()` now returns structured `steps[]` and `toolCalls[]` for the append-only log.

### Changed
- **Export memory** now produces the full, self-contained agent state by default on every interface (issue #18). The browser **Export memory** topbar button writes `formal-ai-memory.lino` as a complete `formal_ai_bundle` — seed files (rules, concepts, tools, multilingual responses), UI preferences, environment metadata, version, and the full append-only event log — instead of only the in-session events. `formal-ai memory export` matches: it defaults to the full bundle and accepts `--events-only` to opt back into the legacy `demo_memory` shape (R109, R113).

### Added
- `FormalAiMemory.exportFullMemory({ seed, events, preferences, info })`, `FormalAiMemory.importFullMemory(text)`, and `FormalAiMemory.suggestMigrations({ imported, current })` in `src/web/memory.js`, mirrored on the Rust side by `memory::export_full_memory`, `memory::import_full_memory`, `memory::suggest_migrations`, `BundleInfo`, and `ParsedBundle` (re-exported from `formal_ai`'s crate root) so embedders writing their own surface get the same defaults (R109, R110, R111, R113).
- Header-agnostic imports: both `formal-ai memory import` / `formal-ai bundle import` (CLI) and `handleImportMemory` (browser) auto-detect `formal_ai_bundle` and legacy `demo_memory` documents so older exports keep round-tripping (R110).
- Seed-version migration suggestions on import. When the imported bundle's `agent_info.version` differs from the running app, the browser memory-status indicator and the CLI (`Migration: <message>` via `eprintln!`) tell the user what changed in `data/seed/` so they can take action without reading code (R111).
- Rewritten **Attach full memory** block in the prefilled "Report issue" body: explicitly tells users that the export is the full memory of the agent, walks them through wrapping it in a `.zip` on macOS / Windows / Linux (GitHub does not yet accept `.lino` attachments), and reminds them to redact sensitive content (R112).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-18/` with raw GitHub data, root-cause analysis, requirement-to-implementation mapping (R109-R114), and verification notes.
- Playwright e2e coverage in `tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`: `Export memory downloads a full formal_ai_bundle by default` asserts `formal_ai_bundle` / `seed_files` / `preferences` in the downloaded file; `Import memory accepts a formal_ai_bundle and reports seed migrations` exercises the auto-detect path and the migration-suggestion surface; the report-issue test now also asserts the `.zip` and redaction guidance (R114).
- Rust unit coverage in `src/memory.rs`: `full_memory_round_trip_preserves_seed_preferences_and_events`, `import_full_memory_accepts_legacy_demo_memory`, `suggest_migrations_flags_seed_version_drift`, `suggest_migrations_flags_legacy_only_import`, `suggest_migrations_is_quiet_when_versions_match`.

### Fixed
- Hardened the GitHub Pages demo release gate so live e2e tests wait for the exact deployed commit and load cache-busted static assets.

## [0.22.0] - 2026-05-15

- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

### Changed

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

### Added
- Added a Telegram webhook endpoint backed by the symbolic engine, plus execution metadata for hello-world code answers and verification coverage for private and public chat updates.

### Added
- Added a `formal-ai telegram` CLI subcommand that defaults to Telegram long polling (`getUpdates`) and keeps the existing webhook server as `--mode=webhook`, configured through `lino-arguments` so flags, environment variables, and `.lenv`/`.env` files all feed the same parser.
- Introduced `TelegramPollingConfig`, `parse_get_updates_response`, the `TelegramTransport` trait, and a curl-backed default transport so the polling loop is fully unit-tested without a network.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Added
- Added arithmetic, concept-lookup, conversation-recall, and explicit-JavaScript-execution handlers to the universal solver so the same loop now answers "what is 2 + 2?", "what is Wikipedia?", "what is my name?", and "please run this javascript: ..." prompts (issue #14).
- Added `solve_with_history`, `ConversationRole`, and `ConversationTurn` to the library API so every surface can carry conversation memory through the same solver loop.
- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

### Changed
- Re-implemented `docs/demo/formal_ai_worker.js` as a universal-solver port: the hardcoded prompt→answer table is gone and every reply now walks greeting, identity, arithmetic, concept-lookup, recall, JavaScript-execution, hello-world, and unknown-fallback handlers that mirror `src/solver.rs`. JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

### Added
- Multilingual chat across Rust, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and the web demo: greetings, identity, unknown-answer, and concept-lookup handlers reply in Russian, Hindi, and Chinese in addition to English; the input language is detected from Unicode blocks (Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK) (issue #16).
- Browser Wikipedia REST fallback for `What is X?` prompts that miss the offline `CONCEPTS` table; the offline corpus still wins and the network answer carries `source:` evidence so the citation can be audited.
- `data/seed/` as the canonical knowledge surface for every interface: `src/seed.rs` `include_str!`-embeds every `.lino` file and exposes typed accessors (`multilingual_responses`, `concepts`, `tools`, `language_rules`, `prompt_patterns`, `intent_routing`) that the Rust library, CLI binary, HTTP server, and Telegram webhook all read; the browser worker fetches the same files through `src/web/seed_loader.js`.
- Data-driven intent routing via `data/seed/intent-routing.lino` with explicit `keyword` / `phrase` / `token` / `combo` match semantics, replacing hardcoded match arms in the dispatcher.
- `seed::merged_bundle()` / `seed::parse_bundle()` plus their JS mirrors `FormalAiSeed.parseBundle` / `FormalAiSeed.loadFromBundle` give the seed a single-file Links Notation round-trip.
- Append-only memory log in the web demo (`src/web/memory.js`) with Export memory, Import memory, and Download bundle buttons; reasoning steps and tool invocations are recorded alongside chat turns, and no delete/forget/clear API is exposed.
- Tool registry panel surfacing seeded tools (`http_fetch`, `web_search`, `wikipedia_lookup`, `eval_js`, `read_local_file`, `append_memory`, `export_memory`) with a `thinking` vs `agent` mode badge.
- Playwright e2e suite (`tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`) covering multilingual greetings/identity, offline + Wikipedia `What is X?` resolution, export/import round-trip, append-only enforcement, bundle download, tool registry, and reasoning-event logging; runs both against `npx serve src/web` (PR) and against `link-assistant.github.io/formal-ai` (post-deploy).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-16/` with raw GitHub data, online research, requirements-to-implementation mapping, and a Follow-Up section covering the universal seed loader and bundle round-trip.

### Changed
- Moved the deployable demo from `docs/demo/` to `src/web/` so it sits next to the other library/CLI/web sources; the GitHub Pages deploy job already targets `src/web`.
- Relocated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to the repository root next to `VISION.md` and expanded it with R90–R104 (move to `src/web`, multilingual surface, Wikipedia fallback, e2e coverage, export/import, append-only constraint, seed externalization, tool registry UI, reasoning/tool-call events, single-file bundle, universal seed loader, intent routing as data, bundle round-trip).
- Rewrote `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js` to initialise mutable `MULTILINGUAL_ANSWERS`, `CONCEPTS`, and `TOOLS` tables from the seed instead of carrying hardcoded literals; `solve()` now returns structured `steps[]` and `toolCalls[]` for the append-only log.

### Changed
- **Export memory** now produces the full, self-contained agent state by default on every interface (issue #18). The browser **Export memory** topbar button writes `formal-ai-memory.lino` as a complete `formal_ai_bundle` — seed files (rules, concepts, tools, multilingual responses), UI preferences, environment metadata, version, and the full append-only event log — instead of only the in-session events. `formal-ai memory export` matches: it defaults to the full bundle and accepts `--events-only` to opt back into the legacy `demo_memory` shape (R109, R113).

### Added
- `FormalAiMemory.exportFullMemory({ seed, events, preferences, info })`, `FormalAiMemory.importFullMemory(text)`, and `FormalAiMemory.suggestMigrations({ imported, current })` in `src/web/memory.js`, mirrored on the Rust side by `memory::export_full_memory`, `memory::import_full_memory`, `memory::suggest_migrations`, `BundleInfo`, and `ParsedBundle` (re-exported from `formal_ai`'s crate root) so embedders writing their own surface get the same defaults (R109, R110, R111, R113).
- Header-agnostic imports: both `formal-ai memory import` / `formal-ai bundle import` (CLI) and `handleImportMemory` (browser) auto-detect `formal_ai_bundle` and legacy `demo_memory` documents so older exports keep round-tripping (R110).

- `docs/case-studies/issue-18/` with raw GitHub data, root-cause analysis, requirement-to-implementation mapping (R109-R114), and verification notes.
- Playwright e2e coverage in `tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`: `Export memory downloads a full formal_ai_bundle by default` asserts `formal_ai_bundle` / `seed_files` / `preferences` in the downloaded file; `Import memory accepts a formal_ai_bundle and reports seed migrations` exercises the auto-detect path and the migration-suggestion surface; the report-issue test now also asserts the `.zip` and redaction guidance (R114).
- Rust unit coverage in `src/memory.rs`: `full_memory_round_trip_preserves_seed_preferences_and_events`, `import_full_memory_accepts_legacy_demo_memory`, `suggest_migrations_flags_seed_version_drift`, `suggest_migrations_flags_legacy_only_import`, `suggest_migrations_is_quiet_when_versions_match`.

  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

### Changed

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

### Added
- Added a Telegram webhook endpoint backed by the symbolic engine, plus execution metadata for hello-world code answers and verification coverage for private and public chat updates.

### Added
- Added a `formal-ai telegram` CLI subcommand that defaults to Telegram long polling (`getUpdates`) and keeps the existing webhook server as `--mode=webhook`, configured through `lino-arguments` so flags, environment variables, and `.lenv`/`.env` files all feed the same parser.
- Introduced `TelegramPollingConfig`, `parse_get_updates_response`, the `TelegramTransport` trait, and a curl-backed default transport so the polling loop is fully unit-tested without a network.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Added
- Added arithmetic, concept-lookup, conversation-recall, and explicit-JavaScript-execution handlers to the universal solver so the same loop now answers "what is 2 + 2?", "what is Wikipedia?", "what is my name?", and "please run this javascript: ..." prompts (issue #14).
- Added `solve_with_history`, `ConversationRole`, and `ConversationTurn` to the library API so every surface can carry conversation memory through the same solver loop.
- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

### Changed
- Re-implemented `docs/demo/formal_ai_worker.js` as a universal-solver port: the hardcoded prompt→answer table is gone and every reply now walks greeting, identity, arithmetic, concept-lookup, recall, JavaScript-execution, hello-world, and unknown-fallback handlers that mirror `src/solver.rs`. JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

### Added
- Multilingual chat across Rust, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and the web demo: greetings, identity, unknown-answer, and concept-lookup handlers reply in Russian, Hindi, and Chinese in addition to English; the input language is detected from Unicode blocks (Cyrillic, Devanagari, CJK) (issue #16).
- Browser Wikipedia REST fallback for `What is X?` prompts that miss the offline `CONCEPTS` table; the offline corpus still wins and the network answer carries `source:` evidence so the citation can be audited.
- `data/seed/` as the canonical knowledge surface for every interface: `src/seed.rs` `include_str!`-embeds every `.lino` file and exposes typed accessors (`multilingual_responses`, `concepts`, `tools`, `language_rules`, `prompt_patterns`, `intent_routing`) that the Rust library, CLI binary, HTTP server, and Telegram webhook all read; the browser worker fetches the same files through `src/web/seed_loader.js`.
- Data-driven intent routing via `data/seed/intent-routing.lino` with explicit `keyword` / `phrase` / `token` / `combo` match semantics, replacing hardcoded match arms in the dispatcher.
- `seed::merged_bundle()` / `seed::parse_bundle()` plus their JS mirrors `FormalAiSeed.parseBundle` / `FormalAiSeed.loadFromBundle` give the seed a single-file Links Notation round-trip.
- Append-only memory log in the web demo (`src/web/memory.js`) with Export memory, Import memory, and Download bundle buttons; reasoning steps and tool invocations are recorded alongside chat turns, and no delete/forget/clear API is exposed.
- Tool registry panel surfacing seeded tools (`http_fetch`, `web_search`, `wikipedia_lookup`, `eval_js`, `read_local_file`, `append_memory`, `export_memory`) with a `thinking` vs `agent` mode badge.
- Playwright e2e suite (`tests/e2e/tests/multilingual.spec.js`) covering multilingual greetings/identity, offline + Wikipedia `What is X?` resolution, export/import round-trip, append-only enforcement, bundle download, tool registry, and reasoning-event logging; runs both against `npx serve src/web` (PR) and against `link-assistant.github.io/formal-ai` (post-deploy).
- `docs/case-studies/issue-16/` with raw GitHub data, online research, requirements-to-implementation mapping, and a Follow-Up section covering the universal seed loader and bundle round-trip.

### Changed
- Moved the deployable demo from `docs/demo/` to `src/web/` so it sits next to the other library/CLI/web sources; the GitHub Pages deploy job already targets `src/web`.
- Relocated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to the repository root next to `VISION.md` and expanded it with R90–R104 (move to `src/web`, multilingual surface, Wikipedia fallback, e2e coverage, export/import, append-only constraint, seed externalization, tool registry UI, reasoning/tool-call events, single-file bundle, universal seed loader, intent routing as data, bundle round-trip).
- Rewrote `src/web/formal_ai_worker.js` to initialise mutable `MULTILINGUAL_ANSWERS`, `CONCEPTS`, and `TOOLS` tables from the seed instead of carrying hardcoded literals; `solve()` now returns structured `steps[]` and `toolCalls[]` for the append-only log.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Added
- Added arithmetic, concept-lookup, conversation-recall, and explicit-JavaScript-execution handlers to the universal solver so the same loop now answers "what is 2 + 2?", "what is Wikipedia?", "what is my name?", and "please run this javascript: ..." prompts (issue #14).
- Added `solve_with_history`, `ConversationRole`, and `ConversationTurn` to the library API so every surface can carry conversation memory through the same solver loop.
- Added `data/seed/concepts.lino` with offline records for Wikipedia, Wikidata, Wiktionary, Links Notation, doublet links, the universal solver, the event log, WebAssembly, and Rust; each record cites its source for auditability.
- Added `tests/unit/mvp/reasoning_paths.rs` (R85–R88) with 24 tests pinning the new handlers and proving every answer is a projection of the append-only event log rather than a memoized constant.
- Added `examples/universal_solver_tour.rs` which walks every specialized handler through the same `FormalAiEngine::answer` entry point used by the library, CLI, HTTP server, Telegram bot, and demo.

### Changed
- Re-implemented `docs/demo/formal_ai_worker.js` as a universal-solver port: the hardcoded prompt→answer table is gone and every reply now walks greeting, identity, arithmetic, concept-lookup, recall, JavaScript-execution, hello-world, and unknown-fallback handlers that mirror `src/solver.rs`. JavaScript snippets requested with "please run this javascript" are actually executed in the worker sandbox; output, return value, and errors are reported with execution-status evidence.
- Persisted the demo's "Demo on/off" and "Diagnostics" toggles in `localStorage` using a Links Notation encoding (`docs/demo/preferences.js`) so the UI state survives reloads in the same format that grounds the solver's knowledge.

- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fix publish steps overriding workflow-level CARGO_TOKEN fallback, breaking CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN-only configurations (#32)
- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

### Changed

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

### Added
- Added a Telegram webhook endpoint backed by the symbolic engine, plus execution metadata for hello-world code answers and verification coverage for private and public chat updates.

### Added
- Added a `formal-ai telegram` CLI subcommand that defaults to Telegram long polling (`getUpdates`) and keeps the existing webhook server as `--mode=webhook`, configured through `lino-arguments` so flags, environment variables, and `.lenv`/`.env` files all feed the same parser.
- Introduced `TelegramPollingConfig`, `parse_get_updates_response`, the `TelegramTransport` trait, and a curl-backed default transport so the polling loop is fully unit-tested without a network.

### Added
- Added the issue #12 holistic case study, root vision/goals/non-goals documents, and a unit test that keeps the documentation set present and traceable.

### Added
- Added a TDD-style MVP test suite under `tests/unit/mvp/` that pins down the chat surface, code generation, multilingual chat, OpenAI compatibility, Telegram surface, links network, reasoning loop, source cache, agent isolation, translation-via-Links, network visualization, and transparent-state requirements drawn from `VISION.md`, `GOALS.md`, `NON-GOALS.md`, and `docs/REQUIREMENTS.md`. Tests describing not-yet-implemented MVP behavior are marked `#[ignore = "MVP-target: ..."]` so they document expectations without blocking CI; run them locally with `cargo test -- --include-ignored`.

### Added
- Added the universal 11-step solver loop (impulse → formalization → context → history → decomposition → TDD → synthesis → combination → verification → simplification → documentation) and wired it into `FormalAiEngine.answer` so every reply walks the same reasoning pipeline regardless of intent.
- Added a deterministic in-process append-only event log (`EventLog`) that records every step of the loop with content-addressed ids and projects to `evidence_links` plus a Links Notation `steps:` trace block.
- Added lightweight Unicode-block based language detection (`Language::{English, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Unknown}`) so every impulse is tagged with `language:<slug>` evidence.
- Added in-process knowledge graph projection with `GraphNode`/`GraphEdge`/`KnowledgeGraph` and a `/v1/graph` endpoint that returns either Links Notation, JSON, or Graphviz DOT.
- Added `rate_limit` metadata on `/v1/models` responses, SSE streaming for `/v1/chat/completions` when `stream: true` is requested, and a configurable `SolverConfig` (offline mode, autonomy bounds) driven by environment variables.
- Added Telegram trace pointers: every chat reply now ends with a `/trace <id>` footer so users can request the inline event log for the message they just received.

### Changed
- Re-implemented Telegram, OpenAI, and library code paths to consume the universal solver instead of bespoke per-intent helpers, removing the previous hard-coded greeting/identity/hello-world branches in favor of pattern-matched specialized handlers (diagnostic, conversation memory, translation, algorithm synthesis, source-cache refresh, conflict surfacing, policy bounded-autonomy).
- Split `src/solver.rs` into `solver.rs` + `solver_helpers.rs` to keep both modules under the 1000-line hard limit and re-organized the imports so each helper is explicit.

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed

- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

### Fixed
- Deploy the demo through the GitHub Pages workflow artifact path so workflow-sourced Pages deployments fail accurately and expose the deployed URL to Pages e2e tests.

- Start the web demo in interactive demo mode by default, add a live next-dialog countdown, and hide diagnostic trace details unless diagnostics mode is enabled.

### Added
- Added demo chat issue-report links that prefill GitHub issues with dialog history and browser metadata.
- Added a symbolic identity response for "Who are you?" style prompts.

### Removed
- Removed the unused demo composer preview control.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-05-12

- New `get-bump-type.mjs` script to automatically determine version bump from fragments
- Automatic version bumping on merge to main based on changelog fragments
- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts

  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline

  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io

- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes

- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

### Added
- Added the formal-ai proof-of-concept library, CLI, OpenAI-compatible JSON API server, Docker packaging, and GitHub Pages demo.
- Added a markdown-capable chat demo with randomized dialog mode, greeting-first examples, and multi-language hello-world prompts.
- Added Rust-script dataset generation into human-readable Links Notation `.lino` files under `data/`.
- Added Playwright e2e test suite under `tests/e2e/` covering page load, initial messages, quick prompts, chat interactions, demo mode toggle, trace panel, and preview mode.
- Added `test-e2e-local` CI job that serves the demo with a local HTTP server and runs Playwright tests on every PR.
- Added `test-e2e-pages` CI job that runs Playwright tests against the live GitHub Pages URL after each deployment.

### Changed
- Expanded deterministic hello-world responses from Rust-only to Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, and C.
- Extended repository file-size checks to enforce the 1500-line limit for `.lino` dataset chunks.
- Fixed GitHub Pages deployment to publish the React chat demo from `docs/demo/` instead of Rust API documentation.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md

- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

### Changed
- Added explicit GitHub Actions job timeouts and documented Rust test timeout guidance.

### Fixed
- Added a non-blocking warning threshold to the Rust file-size check so near-limit files are surfaced before concurrent PR merges can exceed the hard limit.

### Fixed
- Made `create-github-release.rs` build GitHub release titles as `[Language] X.Y.Z` instead of reusing the tag prefix.

### Added
- Added optional Docker Hub image publishing tied to Rust crate releases, including crates.io visibility waiting, version/latest image tags, and Docker Hub badges in GitHub release notes.

### Changed
- Release completeness checks now self-heal when crates.io exists but configured Docker Hub or GitHub release artifacts are missing.

- Fix non-fast-forward push failures in multi-workflow repos by adding fetch/rebase and push retry logic (#31)
- Add mono-repo path support to check-changelog-fragment.rs, check-version-modification.rs, and create-changelog-fragment.rs
- Add `!cancelled()` guard to test job condition to respect workflow cancellation

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

### Fixed
- Fixed unsupported look-ahead regex in `create-github-release.rs` that caused a panic when parsing CHANGELOG.md. Replaced with a two-step approach using only features supported by Rust's `regex` crate.

### Changed
- Restructured example application as a simple CLI sum calculator using `lino-arguments`
- Renamed default package to `example-sum-package-name` with Unlicense license
- Reorganized test structure: `tests/unit/sum.rs`, `tests/integration/sum.rs`, `tests/unit/ci-cd/`
- Converted experiment scripts into proper unit tests in `tests/unit/ci-cd/changelog_parsing.rs`
- Added CI/CD skip logic for template default package name `example-sum-package-name`
- Updated README.md badges and documentation

### Fixed

- Change detection script now uses per-commit diff instead of full PR diff, so commits touching only non-code files correctly skip CI jobs even when earlier commits in the same PR changed code files

### Fixed
- Make release scripts resolve the publishable crate manifest when the repository root uses a Cargo workspace manifest.

### Fixed
- Decoupled GitHub Pages documentation deployment from package release publication and fixed release-script warning failures under `RUSTFLAGS=-Dwarnings`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Changeset-style fragment format with frontmatter for specifying version bump type
- New `get-bump-type.mjs` script to automatically determine version bump from fragments
- Automatic version bumping on merge to main based on changelog fragments
- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script
- Make lint job independent of changelog check (runs based on file changes only)
- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)
- Updated project structure in README.md to match actual script files in `scripts/` directory
- Fixed example code in README.md that had invalid Rust with two `main` functions

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow
- Added `release_mode` input with "instant" and "changelog-pr" options for manual releases
- Added `--tag-prefix` and `--crates-io-url` options to create-github-release.mjs script
- Added comprehensive case study documentation for Issue #11 in docs/case-studies/issue-11/

### Changed

- Changed changelog fragment check from warning to error (exit 1) to enforce changelog requirements
- Updated job conditions with `always() && !cancelled()` to fix workflow_dispatch job skipping issue
- Renamed manual-release job to "Instant Release" for clarity

### Fixed

- Fixed deprecated `::set-output` GitHub Actions command in version-and-commit.mjs
- Fixed workflow_dispatch triggering issues where lint/build/release jobs were incorrectly skipped

### Fixed

- Fixed changelog fragment check to validate that a fragment is **added in the PR diff** rather than just checking if any fragments exist in the directory. This prevents the check from incorrectly passing when there are leftover fragments from previous PRs that haven't been released yet.

### Changed

- Converted shell scripts in `release.yml` to cross-platform `.mjs` scripts for improved portability and performance:
  - `check-changelog-fragment.mjs` - validates changelog fragment is added in PR diff
  - `git-config.mjs` - configures git user for CI/CD
  - `check-release-needed.mjs` - checks if release is needed
  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
- Added `version-check` job to CI/CD workflow that runs on pull requests
- Added skip logic for automated release branches (changelog-manual-release-*, changeset-release/*, release/*, automated-release/*)

### Changed

- Version modifications in Cargo.toml are now blocked in pull requests to enforce automated release pipeline

### Added

- Added support for `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` as alternative to `CARGO_TOKEN` for crates.io publishing
- Added case study documentation for Issue #17 (yargs reserved word and dual token support)

### Changed

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node

- Updated workflow to use fallback logic: `${{ secrets.CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN || secrets.CARGO_TOKEN }}`
- Improved publish-crate.mjs to check both `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` and `CARGO_TOKEN` environment variables
- Added warning message when neither token is set

### Added
- New `scripts/rust-paths.mjs` utility for automatic Rust package root detection
- Support for both single-language and multi-language repository structures in all CI/CD scripts
- Configuration options via `--rust-root` CLI argument and `RUST_ROOT` environment variable
- Comprehensive case study documentation in `docs/case-studies/issue-19/`

### Changed
- Updated all release scripts to use the new path detection utility:
  - `scripts/bump-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/check-release-needed.mjs`
  - `scripts/collect-changelog.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-bump-type.mjs`
  - `scripts/get-version.mjs`
  - `scripts/publish-crate.mjs`
  - `scripts/version-and-commit.mjs`

### Changed

- **check-release-needed.mjs**: Now checks crates.io API directly instead of git tags to determine if a version is already released. This prevents false positives where git tags exist but the package was never actually published to crates.io.

### Added

- **CI/CD Troubleshooting Guide**: New documentation at `docs/ci-cd/troubleshooting.md` covering common issues like skipped jobs, false positive version checks, publishing failures, and secret configuration.

- **Enhanced Error Handling in publish-crate.mjs**: Added specific detection and helpful error messages for authentication failures, including guidance on secret configuration and workflow setup.

- **Case Study Documentation**: Added comprehensive case study at `docs/case-studies/issue-21/` analyzing CI/CD failures from browser-commander repository (issues #27, #29, #31, #33) with timeline, root causes, and lessons learned.

### Fixed

- **Prevent False Positive Version Checks**: The release workflow now correctly identifies unpublished versions by checking crates.io instead of relying on git tags, which can exist without the package being published.

### Changed

- Translated all CI/CD scripts from JavaScript (.mjs) to Rust (.rs) using rust-script
- Scripts now use native Rust with rust-script for execution in shell
- Removed Node.js dependency from CI/CD pipeline
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use rust-script instead of node
- Updated README and CONTRIBUTING documentation with new script references

### Added

- Cache `restore-keys` for partial cache hits across all workflow jobs
- Explicit `token` parameter in checkout for release jobs
- Code coverage job with `cargo-llvm-cov` and Codecov integration
- Codecov badge in README.md
- Pre-release version support (e.g., `0.1.0-beta.1`) in version parsing
- `--release-label` parameter for multi-language release disambiguation
- `ensure_version_exceeds_published()` logic to prevent publishing duplicate versions
- `get_max_published_version()` to query highest non-yanked version from crates.io
- `max_published_version` output from check-release-needed for downstream use
- Version fallback logic in auto-release Create GitHub Release step

### Changed

- Updated `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6
- Updated `actions/cache` from v4 to v5
- Updated `peter-evans/create-pull-request` from v7 to v8
- Made `publish-crate.rs` fail (exit 1) when version already exists on crates.io
- Improved `create-github-release.rs` to check combined stdout+stderr and detect "Validation Failed"

### Fixed

- Fixed `version-and-commit.rs` to check crates.io instead of git tags for determining if a version is already released
- This prevents the release pipeline from getting stuck when git tags exist without corresponding crates.io publication

### Added

- Added `--tag-prefix` support to `version-and-commit.rs` for multi-language repository compatibility
- Added crates.io and docs.rs badges to README.md
- Added automatic crates.io and docs.rs badge injection in GitHub release notes
- Added documentation deployment job to CI/CD pipeline (deploys to GitHub Pages after release)
- Added case study documentation for issue #25

- Detailed documentation for the changelog fragment system in `changelog.d/README.md`

### Changed
- Updated `collect-changelog.mjs` to strip frontmatter when collecting fragments
- Updated `version-and-commit.mjs` to handle frontmatter in fragments
- Enhanced release workflow to automatically determine bump type from changesets

### Changed
- Add `detect-changes` job with cross-platform `detect-code-changes.mjs` script

- Allow docs-only PRs without changelog fragment requirement
- Handle changelog check 'skipped' state in dependent jobs
- Exclude `changelog.d/`, `docs/`, `experiments/`, `examples/` folders and markdown files from code changes detection

### Fixed
- Fixed README.md to correctly reference Node.js scripts (`.mjs`) instead of Python scripts (`.py`)

### Added

- Added crates.io publishing support to CI/CD workflow

  - `publish-crate.mjs` - publishes package to crates.io
  - `create-changelog-fragment.mjs` - creates changelog fragments for manual releases
  - `get-version.mjs` - gets current version from Cargo.toml

### Added

- Added `check-version-modification.mjs` script to detect manual version changes in Cargo.toml
