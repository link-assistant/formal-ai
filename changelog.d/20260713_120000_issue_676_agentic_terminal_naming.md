### Fixed
- Agentic planner now runs any seed shell token (`pwd`, `git`, `cargo`, …) named in a
  prompt, not just `ls`. `execute pwd`, `run git status`, and their many phrasings map
  to the real command (issue #676).
- Natural-language file-listing requests such as "give me a list of files in current
  folder" resolve to `ls` across many more phrasings (issue #676).
