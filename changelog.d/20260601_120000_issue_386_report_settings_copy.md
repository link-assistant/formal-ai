### Added
- Settings panel can reset each setting to its default individually, or all of
  them at once (issue #386).
- Conversations list can copy the whole dialog as Markdown; with diagnostics
  mode on, reasoning steps are folded in after each AI message (issue #386).

### Changed
- Prompt recognition references *meanings*, not hardcoded word lists. A new
  canonical lexicon (`data/seed/meanings.lino`) defines language-independent,
  self-describing meanings — each `defined_by` other meanings (a closed graph in
  the spirit of relative-meta-logic), grounded in real lexical data
  (`wiktionary`), tagged with the semantic `role`s it plays, and lexicalised in
  every supported language. The program-artifact follow-up gate
  (`src/program_coreference.rs` and its `formal_ai_worker.js` mirror) no longer
  enumerates ~100 per-language words; it asks the lexicon which surface words
  evidence a `program_artifact` and a `program_modification`, so the words live
  once in data while the code understands the concepts (issue #386).
- Unit-incompatibility detection (`src/solver_handler_units.rs`) is now
  data-driven too. The units, the physical dimensions they measure, and their
  surface words in every supported language live in the lexicon
  (`data/seed/meanings-units.lino`), where each unit meaning is `defined_by` the
  dimension it measures. The handler walks every `measurement_unit` meaning and
  resolves its dimension label through the `defined_by` graph, so the code knows
  only the concepts "measurement unit" and "physical dimension" — no hardcoded
  unit arrays remain. The lexicon is split across `meanings*.lino` files (listed
  by `MEANING_FILES`) so no single seed file breaches the file-size guard; the
  Rust loader and the `formal_ai_worker.js` mirror both walk every `meanings`
  container (issue #386).
- Calendar weekday reasoning (`src/solver_handlers/calendar.rs` and its
  `formal_ai_worker.js` mirror) is data-driven too. The seven weekdays, the
  "day after"/"day before" relations, "today", the day/date/week references, and
  the interrogatives that ask "which day" now live as self-describing meanings
  in `data/seed/meanings-calendar.lino` — each `defined_by` the calendar
  concepts it builds on and lexicalised in every supported language. The handler
  detects the operation and weekday by querying the lexicon for the
  `calendar_direction_next`/`calendar_direction_previous`/`calendar_weekday`/…
  roles instead of matching hardcoded alias and marker arrays. Because the words
  now exist in every language, weekday-relation answers work in Hindi and
  Chinese as well as English and Russian — not only the originally supported
  cases (issue #386).
- Knowledge-base fact-relation detection
  (`src/solver_handlers/benchmark_prompts.rs`) is data-driven too. The nine
  relations a fact query can ask about (capital, population, currency, official
  language, continent, book author, painting painter, build year, physical
  constant) and the surface words that evidence each one in every supported
  language now live as self-describing meanings in
  `data/seed/meanings-facts.lino` — each `defined_by` a `knowledge_relation`
  concept that is in turn `defined_by` `knowledge_subject` and `knowledge_value`
  (a closed cycle in the spirit of relative-meta-logic). `detect_relation` walks
  every meaning carrying the `fact_relation` role in declaration order instead
  of the former hardcoded per-language keyword table, so the code knows only the
  concept "a relation maps a subject to a value" while the words live once in
  data. Declaration order is preserved so the shared "написал" verb still
  resolves to the book author before the painting painter, and the relation
  slugs (hence the `fact_query:relation:*` reasoning trace) stay identical to the
  browser worker (issue #386).
- The prefilled "Report issue" body omits settings already at their shipped
  default (Mode, Status, Diagnostics, Theme, Guess/Follow-up probability,
  Temperature, inference-only Location), folds the worker into the version line
  (`<version> (wasm)`), shortens the attach-memory section to a docs pointer, and
  drops the Reasoning Trace when the dialog was trimmed to fit GitHub's URL cap
  (issue #386).
- Documented the issue #386 case study (`docs/case-studies/issue-386/`) with raw
  data, a reconstructed timeline, the full requirements list, a corrected
  root-cause analysis of the "Отмени сортировку" refusal, and the implemented
  inverse-derivation fix.

### Fixed
- The follow-up "Отмени сортировку" ("cancel the sorting") no longer returns
  `intent: unknown`. Operations now declare their inverse in the seed
  (`cancel_reverse_sort` carries `inverse "reverse_sort"`), and the subtractive
  substitution rules are *derived at runtime* by mirroring the additive ones, so
  a "cancel X" follow-up lowers the accumulated program back through "X" —
  restoring the ascending sort while keeping earlier edits such as the path
  argument. Adding a new cancellable operation is now pure seed data with no new
  control flow, and the behavior is covered across English, Russian, Hindi, and
  Chinese in both the Rust solver and the web worker (issue #386).
