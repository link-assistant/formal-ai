### Added
- Settings panel can reset each setting to its default individually, or all of
  them at once (issue #386).
- Conversations list can copy the whole dialog as Markdown; with diagnostics
  mode on, reasoning steps are folded in after each AI message (issue #386).

### Changed
- The prefilled "Report issue" body omits settings already at their shipped
  default (Mode, Status, Diagnostics, Theme, Guess/Follow-up probability,
  Temperature, inference-only Location), folds the worker into the version line
  (`<version> (wasm)`), shortens the attach-memory section to a docs pointer, and
  drops the Reasoning Trace when the dialog was trimmed to fit GitHub's URL cap
  (issue #386).
- Documented the issue #386 case study (`docs/case-studies/issue-386/`) with raw
  data, a reconstructed timeline, the full requirements list, a corrected
  root-cause analysis of the "Отмени сортировку" refusal, and the implemented
  inverse-derivation fix.
- Hardened the seed-mirror invariant so the cross-place fix can never silently
  drift: a unit test now enforces that the browser demo's `src/web/seed/` is
  byte-identical to the canonical `data/seed/` (the `scripts/sync-seed.sh
  --check` contract), running in the PR-gated suite on every OS instead of only
  via the deploy/E2E re-sync, which is skipped on docs-only commits (issue #386).

### Fixed
- The follow-up "Отмени сортировку" ("cancel the sorting") no longer returns
  `intent: unknown`. Operations now declare their inverse in the seed
  (`cancel_reverse_sort` carries `inverse "reverse_sort"`), and the subtractive
  substitution rules are *derived at runtime* by mirroring the additive ones, so
  a "cancel X" follow-up lowers the accumulated program back through "X" —
  restoring the ascending sort while keeping earlier edits such as the path
  argument. Adding a new cancellable operation is now pure seed data with no new
  control flow, and the behavior is covered across English, Russian, Hindi, and
  Chinese in both the Rust solver and the web worker (issue #386).
