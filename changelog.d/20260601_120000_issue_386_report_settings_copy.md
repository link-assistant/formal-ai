### Added
- Settings panel can reset each setting to its default individually, or all of
  them at once (issue #386).
- Conversations list can copy the whole dialog as Markdown; with diagnostics
  mode on, reasoning steps are folded in after each AI message (issue #386).

### Changed
- The prefilled "Report issue" body omits settings already at their shipped
  default (Mode, Status, Diagnostics, Theme, Guess/Follow-up probability,
  Temperature, inference-only Location), folds the worker into the version line
  (`<version> (wasm)`), shortens the attach-memory section to a docs pointer, and
  drops the Reasoning Trace when the dialog was trimmed to fit GitHub's URL cap
  (issue #386).
- Documented the issue #386 case study (`docs/case-studies/issue-386/`) with raw
  data, a reconstructed timeline, the full requirements list, and a root-cause
  analysis of the "Отмени сортировку" refusal plus a staged solution plan.
